## Front-end at SIRIS

Part of the stuff released by SIRIS Academic consist of data-driven tools.
Among those tools, some of them are web-based, which means we do a lot
of front end development, so we rely on a toolset consisting on web frameworks
and related libraries assisting us on data tasks as analysis and visulization.

### Technology agnostic

We are unbiased towards the use of different technology tools to solve different problems. 
We believe there is no 'one size fits' all in the website development industry.
That means that we are not tied to any specific technology stack, instead we look
for the best technology to solve each specific problem. 

Reason to be technology agnostic is that as of today we are project-based, 
which means that we tackle different needs and differents problems everytime, so
it has no sense to be opinionated on using one technology on top of another.

## Roles on Front-end development

Tech crew at SIRIS often wear many hats in terms of technology. However, and for
clarification purposes, is it good to specify two different disciplines when
doing front-end development:

**Front-end designers** design, write, and implement the
presentational code base for websites and applications. They should
have a clear understanding of design fundamentals and systems, such
as interface style guides, responsive design, grid systems, front-end
frameworks, and accessibility best practices. Front-end designers
should feel comfortable creating and implementing design systems
using semantic HTML5, CSS/Sass and be able to assist in debugging
this aspect of the code base.

**Front-end developers** architect, write, and implement the
functional code base for websites and applications. They should have
a clear understanding of client-side render and response, such as
HTTP methods, API consumption, the browser loading/rendering
pipeline, and accessibility best practices. Front-end developers
should feel comfortable developing and implementing client-side
interactions and frameworks using semantic HTML5 and JavaScript, and
should be able to help with debugging, testing, and performance
optimization of the code base.
