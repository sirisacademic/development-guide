A set of guidelines and best practices for an awesome engineering team

## How we classify best practices

These documents are structured by topic; under each, we include "Requirement",
"Standard", "Default", "Suggestion", "Caution" and "to-do".

{%include components/tag-requirement.html %} indicates practices that *must* be done for
regulatory, legal, compliance, or other reasons.

{%include components/tag-standard.html %} signifies practices that have a strong consensus across SIRIS Academic; they
should generally be followed to ease the internal sharing and make on-boarding
simpler.

{%include components/tag-default.html %} practices are safe selections that tend to be used by a large number of our
projects; you may find yourself with a better or more tailored solution,
however.

{%include components/tag-suggestion.html %} indicates examples that have worked well on a project or two;
they're not widely used enough to be defaults, but are worth considering.

{%include components/tag-caution.html %} marks approaches that have significant pitfalls or should not be used for
security/compliance reasons.

{%include components/tag-todo.html %} indicates a point that needs to be documented and/or also implemented
