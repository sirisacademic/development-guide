# Wireframing

A wireframe is a visual representation of a user interface, stripped of any visual design or branding elements. It is used by UX Designers to define the heirachy of items on a screen and communicate what the items on that page should be based on user needs.

## Tools for prototyping
{%include components/tag-default.html %}
Our main tool for for UI/UX design is [Adobe XD](https://www.adobe.com/products/xd.html) from Adobe, since it allows the creation of low-fidelity mock-ups.

### What should a wireframe look like?
Most wireframes are essentially black and white diagrams with various UI elements and notes upon them. In most cases they should be devoid of imagery, branding and colour (aside from links/call outs).

At SIRIS, we create wireframes to provide a first raw draft of how the User interface would look like. Since most of the products we release are data-driven, our wireframes use to contain high-level views
of how our data-views and charts look like, and which information they represent. 

Below you can see some mockups, part of a wider dashboard:

As mentioned before, most of the functional mock-up we produce recreate data-driven interfaces, so before starting to think about the UI, it's crucial to spend time exploring the data, and do a previous [Exploratory Data Analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exploratory_data_analysis). 

EDA allows us to extract the main characteristics of the data, through visual methods. This enables us to think a proper representation of the data (which graph suits betters with the data), and which interactions we want to perform over it (which UI controls such selections, filters... can be useful).
