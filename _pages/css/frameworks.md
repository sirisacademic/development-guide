# Frameworks

Most of the project within SIRIS use [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) as default CSS framework.
Bootstrap is agnostic regarding web frameworks, so it's acceptable and in occassions desirable to use other frameworks tied to specific projects.

For the case of projects using React, [Semantic UI React](https://react.semantic-ui.com/) is a good option to speed up the development. Other web frameworks could pair well with different CSS framework as well. 

Below a list of CSS frameworks used so far:

1. [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) {%include components/tag-suggestion.html %}
2. [Semantic UI React](https://react.semantic-ui.com/)
3. [Angular Bootstrap](https://angular-ui.github.io/bootstrap/)

These frameworks were chosen because they're relatively unopinionated about
design decisions while still providing the helpers that make frameworks
essential to fast and accurate frontend work, for example, solutions for
responsive design, grids, and common design patterns. In addition, both
frameworks, through modular design and excellent documentation, make it easy
for the designer or developer to only use the parts that they need, rather than
including a hefty library.
