# Third-Party Integrations

Our software is built on the shoulders of giants. We use several third parties
to perform continuous monitoring, host our apps, etc.; 

## Defaults

We use a set of services that provide for consistency and shared knowledge across projects.
These are good defaults should their need arise; you should generally think twice before building these tools yourself.
